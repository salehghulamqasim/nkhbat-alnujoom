- **Eagle-Eye Schedule View** — Full tournament overview with filter, download (PNG/PDF), and share

- **RTL Support** — Full Arabic/English bilingual UI with `dir="rtl"` handling
- **Dark Theme** — Muted dark interface with gold accent palette

## What We Fixed & Built

### Layout & Navigation
- Fixed RTL navigation: `grid-cols-4` with conditional `dir` for correct tab order (Home leftmost in English, rightmost in Arabic)
- Redesigned bottom nav with raised FAB for Eagle-Eye access
- Added `pb-safe` for mobile safe-area-inset-bottom

### Schedule Page
- Replaced react-big-calendar with a clean custom schedule view after the calendar library caused issues
- Eagle-Eye view: 3-group grid with match cards, status colors (live/complete/scheduled), and match detail modal
- Group filter chips for quick navigation
- Viewport-preserved scroll on group toggle

### Download & Share
- `html2canvas` capture at 2x for crisp PNG/PDF exports
- Native Web Share API with image file attachment (WhatsApp, AirDrop, etc.)
- Clipboard fallback + modal fallback for desktop

### Data Layer
- All data migrated to Firebase Realtime Database + Firestore (no localStorage)
- Firebase rules opened for public read/write (tournament data)
- ErrorBoundary wrapping to prevent full-page crashes
- React Query hooks for public pages, zustand stores for admin

### Hero Section
- Arabic title now right-aligned (`text-right` when `isAr`)
- Title centered vertically on cup background image
- Raised position with responsive padding

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

## Known Issues

- Firebase tokens in `.git-credentials` may expire — push via SSH (`git@github.com`) instead
- `pnpm install` may error on `core-js` build scripts; use `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` directly if needed
